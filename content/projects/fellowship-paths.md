"I thought it was a neat idea. Some of the paths are obvious: only Anesthesiologists can go into pediatric anesthesiology. Some of the other paths are more interesting: a Surgical Critical Care fellowship can be achieved through General Surgery and the Surgical Subspecialties as well as Emergency Medicine, Anesthesiology and OB/Gyn."
